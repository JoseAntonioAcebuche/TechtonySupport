## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Implement **new parking rate structures** in the ATC parking system.
- Validate rate logic (first-hour charge, succeeding hour increments).
- Ensure **visual compliance** with publicly displayed signage.
- Conduct **controlled testing** before production rollout.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Highlights

- All rate updates were tested **in a non-production environment** prior to live activation.
- Sample tickets were printed and reviewed to confirm **accurate rate calculations**.
- Onsite validation was performed using kiosk-generated receipts and system logs.
- The updated rates were synced with system displays to prevent miscommunication.
