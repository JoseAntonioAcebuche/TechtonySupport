# ⚠️ Common Causes of Data Corruption

**Author:** Jose Antonio Acebuche  
**Purpose:** To identify frequent causes of data corruption in production environments and how to mitigate them.

## 🧨 Typical Scenarios That Cause Data Corruption

### 1. 🔌 Sudden Power Loss
- Occurs when a system or server is turned off abruptly (e.g., power outage, unplugging).
- Can corrupt:
  - SQL database files (`.mdf`, `.ldf`)
  - Application logs or config files
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Use a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and auto-shutdown scripts.

---

### 2. 💥 Forced Shutdown or Restart During Write Operations
- Restarting while the system is writing data (e.g., printing, saving, uploading).
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Ensure all processes complete before restarting. Use shutdown logs to trace improper restarts.

---

### 3. 🦠 Malware or Viruses
- Infected systems may modify, encrypt, or delete data files.
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Use updated antivirus and only allow trusted software on terminals.

---

### 4. ❌ Disk Errors or Bad Sectors
- Damaged hard drives (HDDs/SSDs) can silently corrupt files.
- Symptoms:
  - SQL Server fails to attach database
  - File can’t be read or copied
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Use `chkdsk`, SMART tools, and regular backups. Replace failing drives immediately.

---

### 5. 🔄 Incomplete Backups or Restores
- Restoring a partial `.bak` file or backing up during a transaction may lead to inconsistencies.
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Use scheduled backups during low activity. Always test restores on a separate environment.

---

### 6. 📶 Network Instability (For Remote Databases or POS Systems)
- Dropouts during sync or write operations between client and server.
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Ensure stable network and use retry logic for critical transactions.

---

### 7. 👤 Human Error
- Manual edits to database tables, deletion of rows, or misconfigured settings.
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Implement user roles and restrict access to production DBs.

---

### 8. 🔀 Conflicts from Simultaneous Access
- Multiple users or services modifying the same data at the same time.
- 💡 **Mitigation:** Use transactions with proper isolation levels. Audit logs help trace conflicts.

## 🛡️ Best Practices to Prevent Corruption
- Enable **SQL Server recovery model** (`FULL` for production).
- Always backup before updates or configuration changes.
- Store backups in multiple locations (e.g., local + external drive).
- Regularly monitor disk health and server uptime.
- Implement a **data integrity check script** using tools like `DBCC CHECKDB`.
