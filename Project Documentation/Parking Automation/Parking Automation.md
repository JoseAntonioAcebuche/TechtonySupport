| Date       | Task                          | Status     |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| [MM/DD]    | Equipment delivery             | Completed  |
| [MM/DD]    | Hardware installation (barrier & kiosk) | Completed |
| [MM/DD]    | Network configuration & testing | Completed  |
| [MM/DD]    | POS and SQL Server sync        | Completed  |
| [MM/DD]    | System testing and live run    | Completed  |

## 🧪 Testing Results

- All entry/exit barriers triggered as expected
- Real-time data reflected in the SQL Server backend
- Payments processed and reflected in POS logs
- Kiosk restart script tested (Linux-based)

---

## 🧩 Issues Encountered

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Barrier gate delay | Signal loss from control board | Replaced relay and re-tested |
| Kiosk not syncing | Wrong IP gateway setting | Reconfigured network settings |
| POS printing issue | Paper jam | Cleared jam, tested printout |

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- Always confirm LAN switch link light and IP mapping before live testing
- Backup the SQL database **before** syncing kiosk logs
- Ensure the kiosk power source is on UPS to prevent data loss

---

## 👨‍💻 Contributions

- Led onsite hardware installation
- Configured LAN and server connection
- Deployed and tested SQL sync manually
- Wrote initial technical documentation for support team
