## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to:

## ⚙️ Implementation Highlights

- All rate updates were tested **in a non-production environment** prior to live activation.
- Sample tickets were printed and reviewed to confirm **accurate rate calculations**.
- Onsite validation was performed using kiosk-generated receipts and system logs.
- The updated rates were synced with system displays to prevent miscommunication.
