# ðŸš€ Deployment Stage â€“ Parking Rate Update (Revised with Z-Read and Midnight Upload)

## Objectives:
- Roll out the validated rate configuration (masterfile) to the live production environment
- Ensure all terminals reflect the new parking rate logic
- Verify successful application and ticket output

---

## Key Actions:
- Confirmed all terminals completed their **Z-read** (end-of-day report) before deploying updates
- Uploaded the updated **masterfile** to each terminal after successful Z-read
- Deployment was scheduled during **Windows time midnight** to avoid interference with operational hours and ensure clean application
- Verified masterfile upload on each terminal:
  - Checked configuration status or version indicator
  - Rebooted or refreshed terminal if needed to apply new settings
- Performed validation by generating sample tickets and comparing printed rates with signage
- Ensured system logs had no errors post-deployment
- Informed mall operations of the successful live update

---

## Notes:
This detailed deployment ensures rate integrity and smooth transition without affecting end-of-day reporting or customer transactions. Midnight upload scheduling helps minimize risks and aligns with business downtime.
