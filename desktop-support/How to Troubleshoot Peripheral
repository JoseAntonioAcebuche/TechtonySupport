# 🛠️ Procedure: How to Troubleshoot Peripherals

**Author:** Jose Antonio Acebuche  
**Purpose:** To provide a systematic guide for identifying and resolving issues with computer peripherals.

## 🧰 Scope:
Applicable to the following common peripherals:
- Receipt printers / USB printers
- Barcode scanners
- Keyboards / Mice
- Card readers
- Monitors / External displays

---

## ✅ Pre-Checks:
- Ensure the **device is plugged in properly** (USB or power cable).
- Confirm that the **device is powered ON** (LED indicator or display).
- Check if the **device is recognized in the OS** (Device Manager / lsusb).

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Procedure

### 1. 🔌 Physical Inspection
- Check for loose cables or frayed wires.
- Try a different USB port or power outlet.
- If using a hub, **connect directly to the PC**.

---

### 2. 💻 Device Recognition
#### On Windows:
- Open **Device Manager**
  - Check for any `!` or `?` symbols next to devices.
  - If not detected, refresh hardware or restart the PC.

#### On Linux:
- Use `lsusb` or `dmesg` to check peripheral detection.

---

### 3. 📦 Driver or Software
- Reinstall or update the device driver.
- Check if the correct **printer driver** or **device software** is installed.
- For USB printers, try deleting and re-adding the printer in **Devices and Printers**.

---

### 4. 🔄 Functionality Test
- Try the peripheral on another system.
- For printers: perform a **self-test** (usually by pressing a specific hardware button).
- For scanners/readers: check if **input is received** on software or logs.

---

### 5. 🧹 Power Cycle
- Unplug the peripheral for 1–2 minutes.
- Restart the computer and reconnect the peripheral.

### 6. ⚠️ Common Errors & Fixes

| Problem                  | Possible Fix                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Device not detected      | Try another USB port, reinstall driver        |
| Printer not printing     | Clear print queue, check for paper/jam/errors |
| Scanner no input         | Reinstall scanning software                   |
| Input lag on keyboard    | Check for wireless interference or try wired  |
| Monitor no signal        | Test cable, try another monitor or PC         |

---

## 📝 Tips:
- Keep a spare known-working device to compare and test.
- Use **event logs** or application logs for deeper analysis.
- Label USB cables and hubs to avoid mix-ups.

---

## 📌 Summary:
Troubleshooting peripherals involves:
- **Physical checks**
- **System recognition**
- **Driver/software validation**
- **Device-specific tests**

Systematic testing ensures efficient fault isolation and reduces downtime.
